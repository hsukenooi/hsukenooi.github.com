<p>I'm 28 and live in Seattle, Washington.</p>
<p>I co-founded <a href="http://decide.com">Decide</a> where I focus on product design. Before that we built a couple different things that although didn't amount to much, we were buildings things that we wanted to build and learned a few things along the way.</p>
<p>Prior to getting into startups I worked for a interactive agency named <a href="http://zaaz.com">ZAAZ</a> doing web analytics and monetization. I attended the University of Washington originally to study Computer Science but found out that Mathematics was more fun.</p>
<p>I grew up in Portland, Oregon but was born in Penang, Malaysia where I spent my summers growing up.</p>
