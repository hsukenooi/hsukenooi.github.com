excerpt: "Most inventors and engineers I've met are like me ... they live in their heads. They're almost like artists. In fact, the very best of them are artists. And artists work best alone .... I'm going to give you some advice that might be hard to take. That advice is: Work alone... Not on a committee. Not on a team."

<p>When we were bootstrapping, we only met once a week (on Monday) and did most of the work at home or in a coffee shop by ourselves. Now that we have an office and there are almost 30 people, coming into the office is the norm.</p>
<p>I felt more productive working by myself and was definitely more creative. Creativity is different for everyone but for me it's being alone, a cup of coffee or tea, without distraction for several hours at a time. Coming to work everyday in a office and interacting with co-workers has a lot of benefits but it's hard to do the really deep work.</p>
<p>Different types of work require different types of environments. Maybe the solution is to get up early and start the day with the deep work, before coming into the office and tackling everything else.</p>
