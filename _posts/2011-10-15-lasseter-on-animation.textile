<blockquote class="alone">
	<p>Character animation isn't the fact that an object looks like a character or has a face and hands. Character animation is when an object moves like it is alive, when it moves like it is thinking and all its movements are generated by its own thought processes... It is the thinking that gives the illusion of life. It is the life that gives meaning to the expression. As Antoine de Saint-Exup&eacute;ry wrote, "It's not the eyes, but the glance &mdash; not the lips but the smile."</p>
