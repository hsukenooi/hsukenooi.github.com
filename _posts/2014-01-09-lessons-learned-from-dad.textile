A Dad's Gift to his Son: Life's Lessons

No order of priority:

<ol>
  <li><b>A Job</b>: Do what makes you happy to a point. If not successful, quickly change your plans.</li>
  <li><b>Finance</b>: No matter what, the (capitalist) world runs on finance. Make sure you are highly capable and conversant. Invest early.</li>
  <li><b>Time</b> is not a limitless commodity. NOW is the time to do it.</li>
  <li><b>Who</b>: Both the size and quality of your network counts. It is not what you know, it is who you know!</li>
  <li><b>Your reputation</b> is priceless: Don't damage it.</li>
  <li><b>Spend</b> 25% less than you make. You will be less stressed.</li>
  <li><b>Where</b> Live in the most competitive place in your chosen Industry.</li>
  <li><b>Boss or Employee</b>: By far, try to be the boss, even a small business.</li>
  <li><b>Health</b>: Nothing matters if you are sick and unhealthy. Period and full stop. Exercise and eat healthy.</li>
  <li><b>Finding a life long wife</b>: Looks don't last, pick someone who is positive in attitude, a doer and vibrant. They last much longer.</li>
</ol>
