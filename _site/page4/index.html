	<p>Do not let your fire go out, spark by irreplaceable spark, in the hopeless swamps of the approximate, the not-quite, the not-yet, the not-at-all. Do not let the hero in your soul perish in lonely frustration for the life you deserved, but have never been able to reach. Check your road and the nature of your battle. The world you desired can be won. It exists, it is real, it is possible, it is yours.</p>

<blockquote>
	<p>Why do people commit their life to blaming their genes for not granting them that talent they desire with their soul?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think there is such thing as talent but far too often people use it as an excuse to not do something. They desire certain skills and admire the &#8220;talented&#8221; few that possess them. Assuming that they were born with such unobtainable &#8220;talent&#8221; that no matter how hard they work they could never obtain, it&#8217;s something you&#8217;re born with they say.</p>
<p>Bullshit.</p>
<p>Talent is a crutch people use to simultaneously say they desire a skill greatly but won&#8217;t exert the necessary effort to obtain it. I always hear people say this about math. That they aren&#8217;t math people. No, you just haven&#8217;t sat down and really worked at it. Your ability in math is directly proportional to your ability to sit down for extended periods of time and stubbornly think about things you don&#8217;t understand.</p>
<p>You can get good at anything.</p>
<p>It could require an enormous amount of work, you&#8217;ll have to make sacrifices, it probably won&#8217;t be much fun but if you want to be good at something you can be. Taking the position that you can&#8217;t be serves you no purpose, you&#8217;re condemned only to those things that you are &#8220;talented&#8221; in. You won&#8217;t know challenge, defeat or failure.</p>
<p>How dreadful.</p>

	<p>A lot of it has to do with the young generation. A general at West Point told me, &#8220;This is the most inspired and inspiring generation to come through West Point since 1945.&#8221; I see the same thing with the young people who come to work for me. They have a sense of responsibility and service and a lack of cynicism that is remarkable and wonderful. It&#8217;s an ethos, and it&#8217;s collective. That&#8217;s what&#8217;s really powerful. It&#8217;s connected technologically. It&#8217;s not grandiose, but there is a fundamental assumption of being part of a much larger world and a much larger set of aspirations. The world can be a really awful, brutal, turbulent place. And yet I&#8217;m hopeful precisely because of this generation of kids. I really think we ought to just give them the keys as soon as we can. Let them run it.</p>

	<p>It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and again, because there is no effort without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows great enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat.</p>
