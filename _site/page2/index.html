			<h1><a href="/blog/2011/02/24/hello-decide/">Hello Decide</a></h1>
<p class="post-meta">Feb 24, 2011</p>
<p>This update is a little late but to borrow from my favorite show, &#8220;Good news, everyone!&#8221;. Our little startup was recently funded and is now Decide. Read the full announcement on our blog.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been asked by a few friends how it feels after almost 2 years without pay, working out of coffee shops. I&#8217;d like to give this rousing speech about the power of hard work and the spirit of entrepreneurism but it doesn&#8217;t seem apt. I&#8217;ll save that for some time later. It feels too much like a beginning for that kind of stuff. Still so much left to do.</p>
<p>Honestly the best bit about all of it is the quality of people we&#8217;ve been able to hire. Not only are they the best at what they do but they&#8217;re good guys. It&#8217;s one of those cliches that&#8217;s totally true, getting to work with talented people you enjoy is what it&#8217;s all about. I don&#8217;t know how I&#8217;ve managed to trick them into letting me work at their company.</p>
<p>I remember all the blog posts I used to read about startups when we were first getting started. I&#8217;ll have to do a post about common startup advice that I&#8217;ve found to be true or untrue.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re interested in working at Decide let me know. We&#8217;re still looking for awesome people.</p>

<p class="post-meta">Nov 12, 2010</p>
<p>A few months ago I was helping a friend brainstorm ideas for a project she wanted to start. She&#8217;s a graphic designer with an itch to do good so we were thinking of a way to put those things together.</p>
<p>tanQ, a play off her last name and thank you, picks a different non-profit each month, designs a tee shirt based on it&#8217;s cause, sells them and donates the proceeds. 1 tee, 1 month, 1 good deed as we like to say.</p>
<p>The cause for November is the <a href="http://www.oregonfoodbank.org/">Oregon Food Bank</a>, tee shirts are available now at <a href="http://tanq.us">tanq.us</a></p>
<p><a href="http://tanq.us"></a>As she likes to say, spread the word, spread the love.</p>

			<h1><a href="/blog/2010/05/05/im-27/">I&#8217;m 27</a></h1>
<p class="post-meta">May 05, 2010</p>
<p>I turned 27 a few weeks ago. I think there is something significant about 27, at least it feels like it to me. I&#8217;ve been fighting the urge to write one of those long, self-reflective, overly dramatic posts about life and the pursuit of happiness but I&#8217;m doing it anyway and you can&#8217;t stop me.</p>
<h4>Things I&#8217;m Thankful For</h4>
<ul>
	<li>I build stuff for a living. How rad is that? When I was 10, I asked one of my best friends who lived across the street whether he wanted to build a website. He said no and I think we rode our bikes to the grocery store to buy candy but that&#8217;s beside the point. I&#8217;ve always been compelled to create and I&#8217;m doing just that.</li>
	<li>I&#8217;ve had the&nbsp;privilege&nbsp;to do some pretty cool stuff, traveled a bunch, climbed the Great Wall, flown an airplane, rode a elephant, rode a giant sea turtle, hiked on glacier, rafted down a waterfall.</li>
	<li>My parents are happy. Father works too hard but honestly he wouldn&#8217;t have it any other way. Mother would probably prefer to see my brother and I more often but now that they&#8217;re living back in Malaysia at least she&#8217;s surrounded by our exceedingly large extended family. I should call her.</li>
	<li>I&#8217;ve met some wonderfully beautiful people.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Things To Do</h4>
<ul>
	<li>Explore! There are so many things to eat, places to be, people to get lost with, trouble to get into, stuff to learn, things to create!</li>
	<li>Build something that is useful to a <em>lot</em> of people.</li>
	<li>Stay optimistic! Life can wear you down. With each disappointment you start to shoot just a little lower, a way to ease future&nbsp;disappointment. It&#8217;s a horrible way to live, hoping for less each year. I hope I shoot higher always.</li>
	<li>Be a better me. I have lots of character flaws, it&#8217;s part of being human. Life is kind of funny, it&#8217;s school in reverse, you take tests first then learn the lesson afterwards. There&#8217;s no a trick to it, be honest with yourself and put in a earnest effort to be better.</li>
	<li>Do good!&nbsp;Teach, encourage, be generous, smile, inspire! We each have our parts to play, it certainly isn&#8217;t quantity over quality or a competition. It&#8217;s caring for people you&#8217;ll never met, being polite to your waiter, making a outrageously big deal about your friends birthday, being a good father. We have a fundamental responsibility to be a positive influence.</li>
</ul>
<p>I think this is the time where I share the magical piece of advice&nbsp;I wish I had when I was younger.. <em>be happy</em>. It&#8217;s pretty simple. Do something your passionate about, be&nbsp;embarrassingly&nbsp;silly more times than you&#8217;ll admit, enjoy the little things that happen everyday,&nbsp;spend time with people you love. I&#8217;m convinced that happiness is more a state of mind than a emotion. People who are happy choose to be happy. Be happy!</p>

<blockquote class="alone">
	<p>For what it&#8217;s worth, it&#8217;s never too late or, in my case, too early to be whoever you want to be. There&#8217;s no time limit, stop whenever you want. You can change or stay the same, there are no rules to this thing. We can make the best or the worst of it. I hope you make the best of it. And I hope you see things that startle you. I hope you feel things you never felt before. I hope you meet people with a different point of view. I hope you live a life you&#8217;re proud of. If you find that you&#8217;re not, I hope you have the strength to start all over again.</p>
