	<h1><a href="/blog/2011/02/24/hello-decide/">Hello Decide</a></h1>
<p class="post-meta">Feb 24, 2011</p>
<p>This update is a little late but to borrow from my favorite show, &#8220;Good news, everyone!&#8221;. Our little startup was recently funded and is now Decide. Read the full announcement on our blog.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been asked by a few friends how it feels after almost 2 years without pay, working out of coffee shops. I&#8217;d like to give this rousing speech about the power of hard work and the spirit of entrepreneurism but it doesn&#8217;t seem apt. I&#8217;ll save that for some time later. It feels too much like a beginning for that kind of stuff. Still so much left to do.</p>
<p>Honestly the best bit about all of it is the quality of people we&#8217;ve been able to hire. Not only are they the best at what they do but they&#8217;re good guys. It&#8217;s one of those cliches that&#8217;s totally true, getting to work with talented people you enjoy is what it&#8217;s all about. I don&#8217;t know how I&#8217;ve managed to trick them into letting me work at their company.</p>
<p>I remember all the blog posts I used to read about startups when we were first getting started. I&#8217;ll have to do a post about common startup advice that I&#8217;ve found to be true or untrue.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re interested in working at Decide let me know. We&#8217;re still looking for awesome people.</p>
