# Hi Friend. 

My name is Hsu Ken Ooi. Iâ€™m currently taking a sabbatical which, as far as I can tell, is an exercise in figuring out what a sabbatical is.

Formally, I was VP of Product at [Weave](http://weave.in) and Co-Founder at [Decide.com](http://decide.com) which was acquired by eBay.

You should follow me on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/hsukenooi).
